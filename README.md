I have 3 or 4 days to develop a Web App for the [Medito foundation](https://meditofoundation.org/).

> Medito Foundation is a nonprofit dedicated to improving mental wellbeing and helping people cope better with depression, stress, anxiety, and any other negative states of mind.

Develop a versatile single web page that can be adapted for various fundraising initiatives, such as hiring personnel, creating ad campaigns, or developing new features. The page should be designed to engage visitors and encourage donations with an interactive and user-friendly interface.
